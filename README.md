# Advent of Code

This is mostly a space for me to play and get better at programming with languages I don't use on a day to day basis. Check the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) website for the exercise list.

Don't look here if you're looking for idiomatic code/examples!

Tips would be appreciated as well - just open an issue with any suggestions :-)
